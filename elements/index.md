# Elements C++ GUI library

![Photon Sampler Image](/assets/img/elements/photon_sampler.jpg)

## Introduction

Elements is a lightweight, fine-grained, resolution independent,
modular GUI library. Elements is designed with these requirements in mind:

1. It should be open source with a liberal, non-viral license.
2. It should be usable in any application and should play well with other GUI
   libraries and frameworks.
3. Corollary to the second requirement is that it can also be used to develop
   plugins. It should not own the event loop and should be able to co-exist
   with components within a plugin host such as VST and AU.
4. It should be resolution independent and allow for HDPI displays.
5. Should not rely on a “visual” GUI editor or code generator.
6. It should have a declarative API using modern C++. Declarative C++ code
   tells you *what* rather than *how* (imperative). The GUI should be
   declared in C++ code.

Elements, is extremely lightweight… and modular. You compose very
fine-grained, flyweight “elements” to form deep element hierarchies using a
declarative interface with heavy emphasis on reuse.

highly successful Open Source projects such as [Boost.Spirit], [Boost.Phoenix]
and [Boost.Fusion]. These libraries are all part of the [Boost Libraries],
a well respected, peer-reviewed, Open Source, collaborative development effort.
