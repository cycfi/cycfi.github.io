This document explains the three key design aspects behind Elements through
examples. The Elements C++ GUI library is:

**Modular:** Elements is very lightweight and extremely modular. You compose
very fine-grained, flyweight "elements" to form deep element hierarchies
using a declarative interface with heavy emphasis on reuse.

**Declarative:** Elements exposes a declarative API using modern C++.
Declarative C++ code tells you *what* rather than *how* (imperative, i.e.
control flow). There are no code generators. The GUI is declared entirely in
C++ code. After a while, code reuse, using a palette of fine-grained
elements, becomes very familiar and intuitive, much like using HTML.

**Interoperable:** Elements is usable in any application and plays well with
other GUI libraries and frameworks. The library is loosely coupled with the
application and windowing system and can co-exist with components within a
host. It should be easy to integrate Elements with any existing application.

## Minimal Example

Specific examples should make it clear. Let's start with a basic window with
a dark grey background. Actually, this is the same as the 'empty' example
provided in the ‘examples’ directory:
[https://github.com/cycfi/elements/tree/master/examples/empty](https://github.com/cycfi/elements/tree/master/examples/empty)

The examples presented here can be found in this link:
[https://github.com/cycfi/elements/tree/master/examples/doc_aspects](https://github.com/cycfi/elements/tree/master/examples/doc_aspects)

```c++
#include <elements.hpp>

using namespace cycfi::elements;

// Main window background color
auto constexpr bkd_color = rgba(35, 35, 37, 255);
auto background = box(bkd_color);

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
{
   app _app(argc, argv);
   window _win(_app.name());
   _win.on_close = [&_app]() { _app.stop(); };

   view view_(_win);

   view_.content(
      background
   );

   _app.run();
   return 0;
}
```

## App and Window

Here, we create an `app` and a `window`, and set the window's `on_close` to
`stop` (quit) the application. `_win.on_close` is called when the window is
closed by the user, thereby quitting the application.

Like any other GUI library or framework, the `app` manages the main event
loop, while the `window` manages application windows. However, take note that
the `app` and the `window` classes are optional. There are certain
situations, like e.g. building plugins or incorporating Elements in another
framework such as QT, where you do not want Elements to manage the event loop
or windows. The important class of interest here is the `view`. In these
cases, you want to embed the `view` directly. You can directly construct a
`view` given a platform window (or widget), as its main `content` view or
child window (or widget).

The `view` does not know anything about drawing or user interaction. Instead,
it relies on its client supplied `content` to do these. Without any
`content`, it is an empty shell. And so this is where it starts to get
interesting. The content of the `view` typically contains multiple layers,
much like typical graphics applications. In this example, we only have one
layer: the `background`.

## Background

```c++
auto background = box(bkd_color);
```

It is a simple, infinitely resizable `box` with the specified color:
`rgba(35, 35, 37, 255)`. It will resize automatically when the window is
resized. We set it as the view's content:

```c++
view_.content(
   background
);
```

Running this example, you get:

![aspects_a](/assets/img/elements/aspects_a.png){: width="60%" }

## Aligns and Sizes

Now let's add a blue round rectangle. We've seen how to create a box: the
background using `box`, passing in a color. A rounded box is created using
`rbox`, passing in the color and the corner radius:

```c++
auto blue_rbox = rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10);
```

The color, this time, is specified by name from the `colors` namespace. The
namespace includes all predefined colors from the [standard HTML Color
Names](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).

We can actually use `blue_rbox` already, as-is, by placing it in another
layer in the view:

```c++
view_.content(
   blue_rbox,
   background
);
```

But like the `box`, the `rbox` is infinitely resizable and will hog the
entire window. What we want is to give it a specific size and center it in
the window. Elements are very lightweight. Most elements do not even have a
size, nor know their position in the view (elements without position
information are inherently relocatable —they can be placed anywhere; the
position is supplied at rendering time).

So we give it a 100x50 size by wrapping it in the `fixed_size` element:

```c++
auto blue_rbox =
   fixed_size(
      { 100, 50 },
      rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10)
   );
```

And then we align it centered (in the x axis) and middle (in the Y axis)
using the `align_center_middle` element:

```c++
auto blue_rbox =
   align_center_middle(
      fixed_size(
         { 100, 50 },
         rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10)
      )
   );
```

Without the alignment element, the main window would have been constrained to
a fixed 100x50 size. There's a multitude of alignment elements available.

So now, we are seeing how fine-grained elements are composed. The `rbox` is
placed inside the `fixed_size` element which is then placed inside a
`align_center_middle` element.

Let's run this example:

![aspects_b](/assets/img/elements/aspects_b.png){: width="60%" }

## Labels, Margins and Layers

Our goal this time is to place some text inside the blue box. The element we
will use is the `label`. Most elements do not have a size, but as an
exception, labels (simple text elements) do. So, instead of fixing the size
of the box using `fixed_size`, we place the label alongside the box in a
`layer` element, but add some margin around the label. Here's how you do it:

```c++
auto blue_rbox =
   align_center_middle(
      layer(
         margin(
            { 25, 20, 25, 18 },
            label("“Dogs are my favorite people”")
         ),
         rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10)
      )
   );
```

If it's not obvious yet, let's take it apart into its constituent pieces:

Step 1: We make a label:

```c++
label("“Dogs are my favorite people”")
```

Step 2: We add margin around it:

```c++
margin(
   { 25, 20, 25, 18 },
   label("“Dogs are my favorite people”")
)
```

Note that like the align elements, there's a multitude of margins such as
`left_margin`, `right_margin`, etc.

Step 3: We make a blue rounded box:

```c++
rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10)
```

Step 4: We place the label and the blue rounded box as siblings in a `layer`
element:

```c++
layer(
   margin(
      { 25, 20, 25, 18 },
      label("“Dogs are my favorite people”")
   ),
   rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10)
)
```

Step 4: Then finally, we place it in the `align_center_middle` element.

Tip: If the element hierarchy gets a bit too deep, use the c++ `auto` to name
sub-parts of the element composition to make it easier to understand.

The `layer` element is a composite element that holds zero or more 'child'
elements. Some of you might have noticed that we already mentioned the
`layer` element before when we were discussing the view's content in the [App
and Window](#app-and-window) section: "The content of the `view` typically
contains multiple layers, much like typical graphics applications". Well,
actually, this is the same `layer` thing here. The view's main content is a
`layer` element.

So now we have:

![aspects_c](/assets/img/elements/aspects_c.png){: width="60%" }

## Let's Make a Button

To demonstrate the fine-grained and modular nature of Elements, it is perhaps
illustrative to say that even the button element is not atomic and is
actually composed of smaller parts. In this section, we will see how one
creates a button from the basic parts that we have dealt with in the previous
sections.

> Take note that this example is only for illustrative purposes. The library
> provides easier ways to make buttons.

A button is composed of two elements that represent its 1) normal and 2)
pushed states. The basic concept here is that things like buttons do not know
how to render themselves, but instead delegate that task to its subjects. The
button takes care of the basic logic behind the the control, including user
interaction and interface with the application via `on_click` callbacks, but
delegates rendering to two external elements. We'll see shortly how that
works.

So we need two elements. Let's reuse the `blue_rbox` we wrote before. We need
two, so this time, we will make a function that takes in a color and returns
a button. Hence, we differentiate the two button states (normal and pushed)
by the color.

```c++
auto btn_rbox(color c)
{
   return
      layer(
         margin(
            { 25, 20, 25, 18 },
            label("“Dogs are my favorite people”")
         ),
         rbox(c, 10)
      );
}
```

Same as before, but with color options. Now, we have another function that
creates the button for us:

```c++
auto make_button()
{
   return layered_button(
      btn_rbox(colors::medium_blue),            // Normal state
      btn_rbox(colors::medium_blue.level(0.8))  // Pushed state
   );
}
```

We have the normal state in medium_blue, and the pushed state, still
medium_blue but with the level down by 0.8 (darker).

And... that's it! Now we have a function that makes our button. We can now
place this button in our view. Of course, like before, we keep in mind that
we want to center the button:

```c++
   view_.content(
      align_center_middle(make_button()),
      background
   );
```

And here it is in action:

<video width="476" height="320" style="margin-left: 30px" controls loop>
  <source type="video/mp4" src="/assets/img/elements/button.mp4">
</video>

Oh, hey, Elements has a gallery —a collection of reusable element
compositions, just like what we did above, but more refined. That gallery is
constantly growing. The possibilities are endless. Composing elements is fun!

## Sliders too!

Guess what, we can make funny sliders too, using the same components we made
in the previous sections!

<video width="476" height="320" style="margin-left: 30px" controls loop>
  <source type="video/mp4" src="/assets/img/elements/funny_slider.mp4">
</video>

Here's the code:

```c++
auto track = hsize(10, box(colors::black));
auto thumb =
   layer(
      margin(
         { 25, 20, 25, 18 },
         label("“Dogs are my favorite people”")
      ),
      rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10)
   );

auto funny_slider = slider(thumb, track);
```

Notice the pattern? It's the same consistent way of composing and assembling
parts. Start with smaller parts. Use them to build ever more complex parts.
The `slider` has two parts: the `track` and the `thumb`. Here, we made a
simple track using the same old box. We made it black. Then, we reused the
same “Dogs are my favorite people” button for the thumb. The result looks
silly, I should say :blush:, but hey, we are trying to make a point!

> Again, take note that this example is only for illustrative purposes. The
> library provides easier, (but less funny :grin:) ways to make sliders.

Now, like before, we add our funny slider to our view:

```c++
   view_.content(
      align_center(funny_slider),
      background
   );
```

But note that, in this case, we want to center the slider only horizontally,
so we use `align_center` instead of `align_center_middle`.

Ok, there you go! Now go and be creative and make your own controls!
