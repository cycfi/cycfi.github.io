## Requirements

Here are the basic requirements and dependencies that you need to satisfy in
order to use the library:

1. A C++17 compiler
2. git
3. [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.5.1 or higher

Additionally, the following libraries are dragged as submodules:

1. The [Cycfi infra library](https://github.com/cycfi/infra/)
2. [portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) Audio I/O library.
3. [portmidi](http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/portmidi/) MIDI I/O library.

### C++17

Q currently supports the MacOS, Windows and Linux. In the Mac, we support
both [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Q is tested with XCode 10
and XCode 11. In Windows, we support Windows 10 with [Visual Studio
2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), although it will probably also
work with older versions of the Visual Studio IDE. In Linux, we support both
[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) and [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) Get the
latest version with a C++17 compiler. The
[CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) IDE is supported on all platforms.

### Git

Clone the Q DSP library and its submodules:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cycfi/Q.git
```

### CMake

Make sure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org) 3.5.1 or higher. Follow the
installation procedure for your platform.

### Generating the Project using CMake

There are multiple ways to generate a project file using CMake depending on
your platform and desired IDE, but here are some examples for MacOS 10.14,
Windows 10 and, and Ubuntu 16.04:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## MacOS

Using [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/):

1. CD to the Q library: `cd Q`
2. Make a build directory: 'mkdir build'
3. CD to the the Q/build directory: `cd build`
4. Invoke cmake: `cmake -G"Xcode" ../`

If successful, cmake will generate an XCode project in the build directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Windows

Using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

1. CD to the Q library: `cd Q`
2. Make a build directory: 'mkdir build'
3. CD to the the Q/build directory: `cd build`
4. Invoke cmake: `cmake -G"Visual Studio 16 2019" ../`

If successful, cmake will generate an Visual Studio solution project in the
build directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Linux

Using [dpkg packaging
system](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPackageManagement), stock g++ compiler
and [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/).

1. Install portaudio dependencies: `sudo apt-get install libasound-dev`
2. CD to the Q library: `cd Q`
3. Make a build directory: 'mkdir build'
4. CD to the the Q/build directory: `cd build`
5. Invoke cmake: `cmake -G"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" ../`

If successful, cmake will generate a CodeBlocks project in the build
directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Build and Test

Build the project generated by cmake.

Try running the tests and examples. If you intend to run the executables
directly from the command line, make sure to change the directory to the same
level where the `audio_files` is (e.g. 1 folder up on XCode builds). Some
tests and examples may require audio clips that are found in this folder.

To make sure everything is OK, try running the `sin_synth.cpp` example. Make
sure your system's default audio device is set up and ready to play audio.
The `sin_synth.cpp` program should play a 5 second 440 Hz sine wave. You
might also want to try running the `list_devices.cpp` example that prints out
all detected audio and MIDI devices.
