## Introduction

The Artist 2D Canvas Library is an abstraction layer with an API inspired by
the HTML5 canvas API. The library presents a lean API modeled after the [HTML
Canvas 2D Context specification]. The API is a not-so-thin layer above various
2D platform-specific and cross-platform 2D "backend" graphics libraries,
such as [Skia] and [Quartz-2D].

The Artist library goes beyond the basic HTML5 canvas API with extensions for
dealing with text layout and mechanisms for text editing, fonts and font
management, path creation and manipulation, and image capture and offscreen
graphics.
