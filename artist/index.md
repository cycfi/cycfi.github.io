## Introduction

The Artist 2D Canvas Library is an abstraction layer with an API inspired by
the HTML5 canvas API. The library presents a lean API modeled after the [HTML
Canvas 2D Context specification]. The API is a not-so-thin layer above various
2D platform-specific and cross-platform 2D "backend" graphics libraries,
such as [Skia] and [Quartz-2D].

The Artist library goes beyond the basic HTML5 canvas API with extensions for
dealing with text layout and mechanisms for text editing, fonts and font
management, path creation and manipulation, and image capture and offscreen
graphics.

## About the Author

Joel got into electronics and programming in the 80s because almost
everything in music, his first love, is becoming electronic and digital.
Since then, he builds his own guitars, effect boxes and synths. He enjoys
playing distortion-laden rock guitar, composes and produces his own music in
his home studio.

Joel de Guzman is the principal architect and engineer at [Cycfi Research]
and a consultant at [Ciere Consulting]. He is a software engineer specializing
in advanced C++ and an advocate of Open Source. He has authored a number of
highly successful Open Source projects such as [Boost.Spirit], [Boost.Phoenix]
and [Boost.Fusion]. These libraries are all part of the [Boost Libraries],
a well respected, peer-reviewed, Open Source, collaborative development effort.
