## About the Author

Joel got into electronics and programming in the 80s because almost
everything in music, his first love, is becoming electronic and digital.
Since then, he builds his own guitars, effect boxes and synths. He enjoys
playing distortion-laden rock guitar, composes and produces his own music in
his home studio.

Joel de Guzman is the principal architect and engineer at [Cycfi Research]
and a consultant at [Ciere Consulting]. He is a software engineer specializing
in advanced C++ and an advocate of Open Source. He has authored a number of
highly successful Open Source projects such as [Boost.Spirit], [Boost.Phoenix]
and [Boost.Fusion]. These libraries are all part of the [Boost Libraries],
a well respected, peer-reviewed, Open Source, collaborative development effort.
